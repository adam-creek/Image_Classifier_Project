This GitHub repo contains the project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 

The objective of the project is to develop an neural network image classifier in order to recognise different species of flowers utilising PyTorch. The project will be initially developed in a Jupyter notebook, with additional user options made avaliable once converted into a command line application. 

The project consists of the following components:

1) Load and preprocess the image dataset. 

2) Select and define a suitable feed-foward classifier on a subset of the dataset, and save the classifer model.

3) Using the trained classifer, predict new images according to the flower species.
